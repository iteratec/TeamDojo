## Context

We use [SPDX license headers](https://reuse.software/tutorial/) instead of pasting the whole license text at the beginning of each file. It is recommended to add license information to every file, so if one copies a file from our repository into another code base the license information is maintained. (Assumed the license information is not removed.) THis helps third ones easily spot out the originating license.

The license tags we use are:

```text
SPDX-FileCopyrightText: the TeamDojo authors
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

Usually we would add our tags by script at the beginning of every file, but this would lead into manual changes of generated code. This has the consequence that every file wil have conflicts on code regeneration. And this will happen on every JHipster update.

## Decision

We only put the license header (SPDX tags) manually only into custom files we created in the repository. We do not add the header to files generated by JHipster. We add the license information for the generated files into a file paragraph in the DEP-5 config (`.reuse/dep5`).  


## Consequences

- We have fewer conflicts on regenerating code.
- We have to remember to add the header manually into each new created file.
- Third parties reusing our code must maintain the originating license information somehow.
