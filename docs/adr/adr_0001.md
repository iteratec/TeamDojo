## Context

JHipster generates the full stack of an application based on
some [model definition (JDL)](https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/intro). This includes the entities, repositories services
controllers etc. So you get all basic CRUD operations for free. But at some point we need to add own business logic.
Usually we try to add it into own services/controllers, but for some cases we need to extend or change the behaviour of
generated code. In the v1 the developers just changed the generated code. This is one of the biggest mistakes you can do
with generated code because this makes it nearly impossible to upgrade to newer versions of the generator because you
have lots of conflicts to merge.

First and only rule for dealing with generated code is: **You never ever change generated code!** The patterns how to _
modify_ the behaviour of generated code are either _subclassing_ or _dependency injection_

David Steinman describes in his Talk [JHipster side-by-side in practice](https://youtu.be/Gg5CYoBdpVo) how to achieve
such a side-by-side implementation.

## Decision

Some basic rules:

1. All custom code **must** be placed in a separate subpackage named "custom". E.g. custom services will be located in
   the package `com.iteratec.teamdojo.service.custom`, custom DTOs in `com.iteratec.teamdojo.service.dto.custom` and so
   on.
2. All custom types extending a generated one **must** be prefixed with `Extended`. E.g. `ExtendedFooService` for a type
   extending `FooService` or `ExtendedFooDTO` for a type extending `FooDTO` and so on.
3. All custom types not extending generated code, but swapping out an existing generated type or add a completely new
   one **must** be prefixed with `Custom`. E.g. `CustomFooReporisotry`.

### Services

There are two use cases to modify behaviour of generated services:

1. Add custom service API and
2. modify existing service API.

#### Add Custom Service API

Imagine a service interface `FooService` with its implementation `FooServiceImpl` and you want to add a new
method `Optional<Foo> findByTitle(String name)` to its API. You can not simply add it to the interface `FooService`
because this breaks the rule of modifying generated code from above. The solution is to extend the interface and
implementation as shown in the following class diagram:

![Extending the service Foo with new API](adr_0001/add_custom_service_api.png)

The basic idea is to extend the existing interface of the service (its API) and add the additional API to this extending
interface:

```java
package com.iteratec.teamdojo.service.custom;

public interface ExtendedFooService extends FooService {
    Optional<Foo> findByTitle(String name);
}
```

Then create a new implementation of the extending interface and also extend the generated service:

```java
package com.iteratec.teamdojo.service.impl.custom;

@Primary // THIS IS MANDATORY to enforce DI to use this implementation!
@Service
public class ExtendedFooServiceImpl extends FooServiceImpl implements ExtendedFooService {
    @Override
    public Optional<Foo> findByTitle(String name) {
        // Your custom business logic goes here.
    }
}  
```

The trick is done by the [dependency injection (DI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) of Spring Boot.
DI works the way that you only specify the interface of a service (or any other type) you want to use. In this example
`private FooService myServcie`. At runtime DI looks for any implementation of the interface, creates an instance of such
an implementation and injects it to the field. Usually there is only one such implementation in typical Spring Boot
applications, but with the pattern described above we have two implementations of `FooService`,
particularly `FooServiceImpl` and `ExtendedFooServiceImpl`. But we want to enforce the DI always to use
our `ExtendedFooServiceImpl`. This is achieved by annotating the extended service with `@Primary`.

To use such an extended service it is necessary to use `ExtendedFooService` instead of `FooService` for autowiring.

#### Modify Existing Service API

Sometimes it is not sufficient to simply add a new method to the service API. In some cases we need to change the
behaviour of an existing implementation. Imagine the `FooService` from above. But this time we want to execute some
additional business logic in the existing `FooDTO save(FooDTO)` method. This works quite the same way as the example
above, but without the need to introduce a new service interface:

![Modify the save method of service Foo](adr_0001/modify_existing_service_api.png)

The only important detail in this approach is to properly override the method. You have to ask: Do I want to add logic
before the original implementation is called or afterwards or both (around) or do I want to implement the method
completely by my own. The code for additional behaviour before and after will look like:

```java
package com.iteratec.teamdojo.service.impl.custom;

@Primary // THIS IS MANDATORY to enforce DI to use this implementation!
@Service
public class ExtendedFooServiceImpl extends FooServiceImpl implements FooService {
    @Override
    public FooDTO save(FooDTO dto) {
        before(dto);
        final var result = super.save(dto);
        after(result);
        return result;
    }

    private void before(FooDTO dto) {
        // Here goes the behavior to add before the original implementation.
    }

    private void after(FooDTO dto) {
        // Here goes the behavior to add after the original implementation.
    }
}
```

This works exactly the same way as the previous example by adding `@Primary` to the implementation. The pattern of this
code is sometimes called _before, after and around pattern_.

### Controllers

For controllers, we have the same requirements as for services, but we can not simply extend an interface and use the
pattern described above for services. In Spring Boot controller components does not have interfaces which describes the
controller API. Instead, controllers uses some annotations to declare the URL routes. Also, we can not simply subclass a
controller to add some custom URL routes because this would result in duplicate URL route definition errors. Let's see
an example. This is a generated controller with some lines omitted for brevity:

```java

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ImageResource {
    @GetMapping("/images")
    public ResponseEntity<List<ImageDTO>> getAllImages(ImageCriteria criteria, Pageable pageable) {
        // ...
    }

    @PostMapping("/images")
    public ResponseEntity<ImageDTO> createImage(@Valid @RequestBody ImageDTO imageDTO) throws URISyntaxException {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

If we simply subclass the generated controller like this:

```java

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ExtendedImageResource extends ImageResource {
    @GetMapping("/image/foobar")
    public ResponseEntity<ImageDTO> getAllImages(ImageCriteria criteria, Pageable pageable) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The result would be duplicate URL routes because `ExtendedImageResource` inherits all methods from `ImageResource` which
includes the methods with the route annotations. Thus, the definitions occur twice in.

So, we need a different approach to extend controller functionality.

#### Add Custom Controller API

For the use case to simply add complete new URL routes we just add a new controller. For the example above to add a new
URL route `/image/foobar` we would create a class `CustomImageResource` in the package
`com.iteratec.teamdojo.web.rest.custom`. (See the convention above that we put all custom code in a sub package `custom`
.) In this class we can define any new URL routes. This controller has now dependency to the generated controller. So
the example from above looks like:

```java

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ExtendedImageResource {
    @GetMapping("/image/foobar")
    public ResponseEntity<ImageDTO> getAllImages(ImageCriteria criteria, Pageable pageable) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Modify Existing Controller API

This use case is quite difficult. At the time of writing we did not find any reasonable method to modify the
implementation of a generated URI route without touching the generated code. (We did not consider bytecode black magic!)
But we tried to find a solution with as few modifications of generated code as possible.

Imagine a given controller where we want to change a URL route implementation:

```java

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class BadgeResource {
    // ...
    @GetMapping("/badges")
    public ResponseEntity<List<BadgeDTO>> getAllBadges(BadgeCriteria criteria, Pageable pageable) {
        log.debug("REST request to get Badges by criteria: {}", criteria);

        // Here we want to add some extra code...

        Page<BadgeDTO> page = badgeQueryService.findByCriteria(criteria, pageable);
        HttpHeaders headers = PaginationUtil.generatePaginationHttpHeaders(ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest(), page);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().headers(headers).body(page.getContent());
    }

    // ...
}
```

The basic idea here is to use decomposition and encapsulation and add the custom code with
a [method object](https://refactoring.guru/replace-method-with-method-object) refactoring. This means that we introduce
a complete new object to hold the custom code we want to add, instead of simply adding it into the generated method.
First we add a new class `CustomBadgeResourceExtension`. We add the suffix `Extension` to signal that this type is used
inside another controller as delegate object to extend its functionality. This type is also placed
in `com.iteratec.teamdojo.web.rest.custom` like custom controllers:

```java

@Component
public class CustomBadgeResourceExtension {

    private final BadgeService badges;
    private final BadgeSkillService badgeSkills;

    public CustomBadgeResourceExtension(final BadgeService badges, final BadgeSkillService badgeSkills) {
        super();
        this.badges = badges;
        this.badgeSkills = badgeSkills;
    }

    public boolean shouldFindBadgesBySkills(final BadgeCriteria criteria) {
        // ...
    }

    public ResponseEntity<List<BadgeDTO>> findBadgesBySkills(final BadgeCriteria criteria, final Pageable pageable) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Important** to note that we add a `@Component` annotation to this extension, so it will be autowired!

Now we add this extension class to the generated controller as delegate:

```java

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class BadgeResource {
    // ...

    // ### MODIFICATION-START ###
    private final CustomBadgeResourceExtension extension;
    // ### MODIFICATION-END ###

    public BadgeResource(
        BadgeService badgeService,
        BadgeRepository badgeRepository,
        BadgeQueryService badgeQueryService,
        // ### MODIFICATION-START ###
        CustomBadgeResourceExtension extension
        // ### MODIFICATION-END ###
    ) {
        this.badgeService = badgeService;
        this.badgeRepository = badgeRepository;
        this.badgeQueryService = badgeQueryService;
        // ### MODIFICATION-START ###
        this.extension = extension;
        // ### MODIFICATION-END ###
    }

    // ...

    @GetMapping("/badges")
    public ResponseEntity<List<BadgeDTO>> getAllBadges(BadgeCriteria criteria, Pageable pageable) {
        log.debug("REST request to get Badges by criteria: {}", criteria);

        // ### MODIFICATION-START ###
        if (extension.shouldFindBadgesBySkills(criteria)) {
            return extension.findBadgesBySkills(criteria, pageable);
        }
        // ### MODIFICATION-END ###

        Page<BadgeDTO> page = badgeQueryService.findByCriteria(criteria, pageable);
        HttpHeaders headers = PaginationUtil.generatePaginationHttpHeaders(ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest(), page);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().headers(headers).body(page.getContent());
    }

    // ...
}
```

With this approach we only have roundabout six lines of modified code surrounded with our modification eyecatcher (see
below). This is way better to handle on upgrade merge conflicts caused by dozens of lines of code added at random places
in the extended controller.

### Repositories

For repositories, it is quite easy to add custom API. Changing existing behaviour is no use case here because Spring
repositories are only defined via interfaces which will be implemented at runtime from the framework. If we want to add
custom API to a repository we simply extend the generated interface in our own
package (`com.iteratec.teamdojo.repository.custom`) and add the methods there. It is important to annotate the extending
repository with `@Repository` too. The convention is to prefix all these extending repositories with "Extended". For
example the generated repository:

```java

@Repository
public interface LevelRepository extends JpaRepository<Level, Long>, JpaSpecificationExecutor<Level> {
}
```

will be extended like:

```java

@Repository
public interface ExtendedLevelRepository extends LevelRepository {
    Page<Level> findByIdIn(List<Long> levelIds, Pageable pageable);
}
```

To use such an extended repository it is necessary to use `ExtendedLevelRepository` instead of `LevelRepository` for
autowiring.

### How to Change Generated Code Anyway

If we need to change generated code for good reasons then we encapsulate each modification in eye-catchers:

```java
class Foo {

    public Page<BadgeDTO> doSomeFoo() {
        log.debug("REST request to get Badges by criteria: {}", criteria);

        // ### MODIFICATION-START ###
        if (extension.shouldFindBadgesBySkills(criteria)) {
            return extension.findBadgesBySkills(criteria, pageable);
        }
        // ### MODIFICATION-END ###

        Page<BadgeDTO> page = badgeQueryService.findByCriteria(criteria, pageable);
        // ...
        return page;
    }
}
```

This allows us to quickly identify custom modifications in the diff if we regenerate the code.

## Consequences

We have some overhead due to additional classes and interfaces, but it is worth the easier upgrade path for new JHipster
versions.
